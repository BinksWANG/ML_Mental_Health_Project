# üß† ML Mental Health Project

## üìå Problem Statement

Mental health is a growing concern worldwide, influenced by many personal and environmental factors. This project aims to build a machine learning pipeline that predicts whether an individual is likely to report a mental health condition based on their demographics, stress levels, lifestyle choices (e.g., sleep, work, physical activity), and occupation.

### Objectives:
- Identify key indicators of mental health conditions
- Build a predictive ML model using real-world data
- Deploy the model in a web environment with Flask and Docker
- Implement monitoring to track performance and detect drift
- Follow best practices for ML development and MLOps

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
### üîπ Phase 0: Environmental Setting
This project follows a modular, automated workflow:

### üîπ Phase 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Load and inspect the Kaggle dataset.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Handle missing values, encode categorical features, scale numeric data.
- Engineer features to enhance model performance.

### üîπ Phase 2: Model Development
- Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Evaluate models using Accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV or Hyperopt).

### üîπ Phase 3: Experiment Tracking & Model Registry
- Use MLflow to:
  - Log experiments
  - Track metrics and parameters
  - Register and version models for production.

### üîπ Phase 4: Deployment
- **Batch Deployment**: Scheduled inference jobs on AWS EC2.
- **Web API Deployment**: REST API using Flask and FastAPI, deployed via AWS Lambda + API Gateway in Docker containers.

### üîπ Phase 5: Monitoring
- Monitor data drift and model performance using Evidently AI.
- Set alerts for performance degradation and trigger retraining if necessary.
