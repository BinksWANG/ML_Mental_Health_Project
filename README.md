# 🧠 ML Mental Health Project

An end-to-end MLOps project for predicting mental health conditions based on demographics, lifestyle, and stress-related data. This implementation uses modern ML and MLOps tools to ensure reproducibility, scalability, and robust deployment.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Mental health is a growing global concern, influenced by various personal and environmental factors. This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict whether an individual is likely to report a mental health condition using their:

- Demographics
- Stress levels
- Lifestyle choices (sleep, work, physical activity)
- Occupation

### Objectives
- Identify key indicators of mental health conditions
- Build and evaluate predictive ML models
- Deploy models via web APIs and batch jobs using Docker and Flask
- Implement monitoring to track performance and detect drift
- Follow MLOps best practices for production-ready systems

---

### Phase 2: Model Development

- Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluate using metrics (Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, Hyperopt)

```bash
# 🏗️ Set up Python environment with Conda

# Create a new conda environment with Python 3.9
conda create -n ml-env python=3.9

# Activate the environment
conda activate ml-env

# Install project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# List installed packages
pip list

# Start MLflow UI
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db
```
